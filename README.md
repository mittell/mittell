Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, a software engineer based in North Wales, I've been working with code for a fairly long time, but over the last 10 years I've been working with:

- C# and .NET
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Vue
- React
- Azure DevOps
- Azure

I'm currently learning more about the following:

- Next.js
- Microservices
- AWS
- Terraform
- LLMs
- Python (maybe... ðŸ˜…)

Please check out my [website](https://www.chrismittell.dev/) for more information on what I'm working on, sometimes I ramble on about other things there, but it's usually technical stuff. ðŸ˜¬
