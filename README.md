### :wave: Introduction

</div>

<div align="left">

I'm Chris Mittell, an experienced Full-Stack Developer from the UK :uk: and now living in Japan :jp:.

At the end of 2021 I was provided with the opportunity to move to Nagoya on a 5-Year Dependent Visa.

Arriving with 7 years experience designing and building websites, web applications, and RESTful API’s utilising the Microsoft Stack. I’m currently looking for a Working Visa sponsorship, and learning to work with JavaScript Stack technologies, including Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and Vue.js.

I’ve worked both independently and in small teams across multiple industries within the UK, and have had exposure to DevOps processes and Cloud-based platforms.

### :grin: About Me

</div>

- I'm a creative person with a flair for technological thinking and building.
- I enjoy working with other people, building great teams, and of course... great software!
- I've tried many independent endeavours including freelance work and tried to run my own Drone startup... needless to say each one didn't find as much success as I hoped. :satisfied:
- I try to mentor at every opportunity, helping people to understand and use technology has always been an interest of mine. While I'm still trying to learn myself and find my way through this amazing world of software, it's a lot more fun when you can help other people too.
