### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Chris, a Full-Stack Developer with experience building solutions with .NET/.NET Core across multiple industries within the UK, including IT/Networking, Retail, Leisure & Tourism, and Life Sciences.

I've recently relocated to Nagoya, Japan, where I'm learning to migrate to Node with the aim of building upon my existing experience and education, and work towards becoming a Software Architect, with a focus on Cloud Technologies and Microservices.

(This will get updated shortly with so many things!)
