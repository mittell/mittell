### :wave: Hello there!

<div align="left">
  
My name is Chris Mittell, and I'm a Full-Stack Developer from the UK :uk: and now living in Japan :jp:.

I would like to say that I'm just a developer with 6+ years experience of building tools, websites, and web applications within the Microsoft Stack, working from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET Core 3.1.

But that feels a little less fun and interesting, so instead, here is what I am and what I'm aiming for:
  
</div>  
  
---

</div>  
  
- I'm a creative person with a flair for technological thinking and building.
- I enjoy working with other people, building great teams, and of course... great software!
- I've often worked alone or in small teams, but my last role catapulted my experience with collaboration across multiple teams involving development, testing, and infrastructure.
- I've tried many independent endeavours including freelance work and even tried to run my own Drone Startup... needless to say each one failed. :satisfied:
- I've found myself mentoring at every opportunity provided to me, helping people understand and use technology has always been a keen interest of mine. I'm still trying to learn and find my own way through this crazy world of software, but where's the fun if we can't help other people at the same time?

---
  
- I want to branch out from working within a Microsoft-only ecosystem and  challenge myself to learn more languages, tools and frameworks.
- I'm currently learning to work with JavaScript driven tools and frameworks, which meant overcoming a lifetime of ES5 and finally modernising with ES6+.
- I also want to learn more about SPA's, Test-Driven Development, Software Architecture and building Microservices.
